## Question 1

You've written the following HTML. When you look at it in your browser, it's just blank! Why?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Quiz
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>What a great site.</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
> There's no closing tag for the title element so it's reading everything that follows as the title...


## Question 2

What's the purpose of the `alt` attribute on image tags?

> Devices/programs that assist the blind to read web pages look at the alt tag to describe the image - particularly important if you are using an image to link to something else, the alt text needs to describe what the link does; similarly, if the image is illustrating something, such as a graph, the alt text should describe what the image is illustrating. Decorative images should just have empty alt text (alt="").

## Question 3

Why does the following code snippet throw an error, and what would fix the error?

```js
var theBody = document.querySelectorAll("body");
theBody.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```
> .querySelectorAll returns an array so you won't be able to call .style directly on the body. You can just write:
```js
document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

## Question 4

Why does the following code snippet throw an error, and what would fix the error?

```css
body{
  background-color = "red";
}
```
> The equal sign should be a colon and you don't need the quotation marks. Should just be
```css
body{
  background-color: red;
}
```

## Question 5

**The scenario:** You're starting a new app. You create a local repo and a repo on Github, create a readme file, and put it on Github. Then you run into Juan, who's already done a lot of the work you were planning to do. You want to pull his code down and include it in your repo, and put your combined code up on your Github repo.

All the steps for one way of doing the above have been written below, but in the wrong order. Put them in the correct order.

```
$ cd project-repo
$ git init project-repo
$ git remote add origin git@github.com/username/project-repo.git
$ touch README.md
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git push origin master
$ git remote add juan git@github.com/juan/project-repo.git
$ git merge juan/feature
$ git push origin master
```

## Question 6

Your Rails database has two tables. `students` has the columns `id` and `name`, and `sandwiches` has the columns `id`, `type`, and `student_id`.

Use ActiveRecord to create a new `pbj` sandwich and make it belong to the student named Geraldo.

```rb
var geraldo = Student.find_by(name: "Geraldo")
geraldo.sandwiches.create(type: "pbj")

```

## Question 7

Using Ruby, instantiate an array called `fruits` that contains `apple`, `banana`, and `orange`.

Then, use an enumerator to print to the console the sentence "I'd like to eat a [fruit]" once for each fruit.

```rb
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
fruits.each do |fruit|
  puts "I'd like to eat a(n) " + fruit
end

```

## Question 8

Write one Express route for each of four HTTP methods.

Then, make each route respond with a one-word string containing the RESTful action that would most likely be associated with this route.

```js
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/artists", function(req, res){
  res.send("GET")
});

app.post("/artists", function(req, res){
  res.send("POST")
});

app.put("/artists/:id", function(req, res){
  res.send("PUT")
});

app.delete("/artists/:id", function(req, res){
  res.send("DELETE")
});

```

## Question 9

What is the difference between the two following lines of code?

```rb
@artist.save
@artist.save!
```

> @artist.save! will throw an error if it can't be saved, whereas without the ! it will just quietly return false.

## Question 10

Using jQuery, write an AJAX request to `http://tunr.com/artists` that would create a new artist with the name of 'Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold', and pop up a box saying "All done!" when complete.

```js
  function aDeerForAndy(){
    $.ajax({
      url: "http://tunr.com/artists",
      type: "POST",
      data: {name: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold"},
      dataType: "json"
    }).done(function(){
      alert("All done!")
    }).fail(function(){
      console.log("No resin deer for you!")
    }).always(function(){
      console.log("Have a nice day.")
    })
  }
```

## Question 11

Due to budget cuts, GA can no longer hire new instructors. Instead they can only instantiate new instructors with Javascript.

Define a Javascript constructor called 'Instructor'. Every instance of Instructor should have a `name` property, and a method called `receivePresent`. This method takes one argument called `gift` and, when executed, console-logs "[name] promptly drops the [gift] on the floor."

Instantiate an instructor named 'Andy' and call its `receivePresent` method with "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold" as the argument.

```js
function Instructor(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.receivePresent = function(gift){ return this.name + "promptly drops the " + gift + " on the floor." };
}

var andy = new Instructor("Andy");
var gift = "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold";
andy.receivePresent(gift);

```

## Question 12

Your Rails app has the following `application.html.erb`. Nothing shows up in your browser on any of your app's pages. Why not?

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html
<html>
<head>
  <title>Quiz</title
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>
  <% yield %>
</body>
</html>
```

> The closing title tag doesn't have the > closing it out, and the yield section in the body should be <%= %> in order for the views to be rendered there.

## Question 13

Of the three options below, which is the most "correct" way of organizing the files that make up an Angular app, as used in class? Why is this option considered "better" than the other two?

> Option B is preferred because controllers and views are grouped together alphabetically within each module, which makes sense because of their close relationship in Angular's modular MVVM system

### A:
```
/js
  app.js
  controllers/
    artist_index.js
    artist_show.js
  directives/
    artist_form.js
    song_form.js
  views/
    artist_index.html
    artist_show.html
    artist_form.html
    song_form.html
```

### B:
```
/js
  app.js
  artists/
    index.controller.js
    index.html
    show.controller.js
    show.html
    form.directive.js
    form.html
  songs/
    form.html
    form.directive.html
```

### C:
```
/js
  app.js
  controllers/
    artists_controller.js
  directives/
    songs_directive.js
/html
  artists/
    index.html
    show.html
    form.html
  songs/
    form.html
```

## Question 14

Convert the following ActiveRecord sequence to Mongoose:

```rb
@andy = Instructor.find_by(name: "Andy")
@andy.wishlist_items.create(description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold")
```

```js
var andy = Instructor.find(name: "Andy")
var deer = new WishlistItem({
  description: "Resin Laying Deer Figurine, Gold"
})
deer.save();
andy.wishlistItems.push(deer);
andy.save();
```
